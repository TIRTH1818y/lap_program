Phase 1: Foundational Programming Concepts (3-4 weeks)
 * Chapter 1: Introduction to Programming
   * What is programming? Why is logic crucial?
   * Problem-solving process: Understand, break down, plan (algorithm/pseudocode), implement, test/debug.
   * Choosing a language (Python, Dart, Java, etc.) and setting up your environment.  Start with one language.
   * "Hello, World!" – your first program.
 * Chapter 2: Variables, Data Types, and Operators
   * Variables: Naming, declaration, assignment.
   * Data types: Integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, characters, strings.
   * Operators: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment.
   * Type conversion (casting).
   * Input and output.
   * Exercises:
     * Basic calculations (area, perimeter, conversions).
     * Number properties (even/odd, positive/negative).
     * String manipulation (concatenation, length).
 * Chapter 3: Control Flow (The Core of Logic)
   * Conditional statements: if, else if/elif, else, switch (if available).
   * Looping structures: for, while, do-while (if available).
   * Nested loops.
   * break and continue statements.
   * Exercises:
     * Number series (Fibonacci, prime numbers).
     * Pattern printing.
     * Menu-driven programs.
     * Input validation.
 * Chapter 4: Functions (Modularizing Logic)
   * Defining and calling functions/methods.
   * Parameters and arguments.
   * Return values.
   * Scope (local vs. global variables).
   * Recursion (introduction).
   * Exercises:
     * Rewrite exercises from Chapter 3 using functions.
     * Create functions for common tasks (e.g., factorial, GCD).
Phase 2: Applying Logic and Introducing Data Structures (6-8 weeks)
 * Chapter 5: Problem-Solving Strategies
   * Breaking down complex problems.
   * Identifying patterns.
   * Thinking about edge cases and error handling.
   * Writing pseudocode/flowcharts before coding.
 * Chapter 6: Basic Algorithms (Applying Logic)
   * Searching: Linear search, binary search.
   * Sorting: Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort.
   * Exercises: Implement these algorithms in your chosen language.
 * Chapter 7: Introduction to Data Structures (C++ Focus)
   * What are data structures? Why are they essential?
   * Abstract Data Types (ADTs).
   * Big O notation (basic introduction to time and space complexity).
 * Chapter 8: Arrays and Strings in C++
   * C-style arrays (if you must, but prefer std::vector).
   * std::vector (dynamic arrays – very important in C++).
   * std::string (string manipulation in C++).
   * Multidimensional arrays and vectors.
   * Exercises: (Rewrite previous array/string exercises using std::vector and std::string)
     * Largest/smallest in array, reverse array, find missing number, anagram check, etc.
 * Chapter 9: Pointers in C++
   * What are pointers? Memory addresses.
   * Pointer arithmetic.
   * Pointers and arrays/vectors.
   * Dynamic memory allocation (new, delete).
   * Smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr – crucial for modern C++).
   * Exercises:  Practice using pointers with arrays/vectors and dynamic memory.
 * Chapter 10: Structures and Classes in C++
   * struct vs. class.
   * Member variables and member functions.
   * Access specifiers (public, private, protected).
   * Constructors and destructors.
   * Operator overloading.
   * Exercises: Create classes/structs for relevant objects (e.g., Matrix, Book, Student).
 * Chapter 11: Linked Lists (C++ Implementation)
   * Singly linked lists.
   * Doubly linked lists.
   * Circular linked lists.
   * Implementing common linked list operations.
   * Exercises: Implement linked list-based stack and queue.
 * Chapter 12: Stacks and Queues (C++ Implementation)
   * Stacks (LIFO).
   * Queues (FIFO).
   * Implementations using arrays/vectors or linked lists.
   * Exercises: Implement stack-based expression evaluation, queue-based BFS (if you introduce graphs).
 * Chapter 13: Trees (Introduction - C++ Implementation)
   * Binary trees.
   * Binary search trees (BSTs).
   * Tree traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder).
   * Exercises: Implement basic tree operations and a BST.
Phase 3: Advanced Topics and Projects (Ongoing)
 * Chapter 14: Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures (C++ Focus)
   * Heaps and priority queues.
   * Hash tables/maps (std::unordered_map, std::map in C++).
   * Graphs (representation, traversal: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm).
   * Advanced sorting (merge sort, quicksort).
   * Dynamic programming (introduction).
 * Chapter 15: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles (Language Agnostic)
   * Encapsulation.
   * Inheritance.
   * Polymorphism.
   * Design patterns (introduction).  These are more about how you structure your code logically.
 * Chapter 16: Projects (Applying Everything)
   * Choose projects that combine the concepts you've learned (data structures, algorithms, OOP).  The project list you provided earlier is an excellent starting point.
 * Chapter 17:  File I/O and External Data (If Applicable)
   * How to read and write data to files in your chosen language.
   * Working with different file formats (text, CSV, JSON, etc.).  This is often essential for real-world applications.
